    <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> In a world where calculators have become nothing but relics of the past, erased from existence, the once thriving civilizations find themselves in the grip of mathematical chaos. The absence of these electronic marvels has plunged the world into an era where the very foundation of knowledge is on the brink of collapse.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>NARRATOR:</strong> But in the shadows of this turmoil, a hero emerges. A figure destined to alter the course of fate, and that hero is you.

</p>

<p>
    <em>[The music swells as you, the hero, stand with the ancient calculator in hand, a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. Scenes of you using the ancient calculator to perform miraculous calculations and restore balance are portrayed.]</em>
